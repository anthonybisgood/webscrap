# housing-prices.py
A program used to scrape the prices of homes on zillow. Can be used for both renting and buying homes. Prompts the user for the city they are interested in and what type of field they are interested in (renting or buying). Gives the user a list of homes based on the price per sqare footage to value the homes.
